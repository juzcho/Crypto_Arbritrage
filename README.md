## Technologies

This project leverages **[python version 3.8.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** with the following packages and modules:

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - This was used to be able to easily manipulate dataframes.

* [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - This was used to locate through the directory or file path. Also, it converts a string and converts that supplied string as a PosixPath that can be utilize by other functions such as reading or writing files to csv files.

* [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - This was used to be able to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
